To remove a Docker network, such as rag_api_network, 
you can use the docker network rm command. However, before you can remove a network, 
you need to ensure that no containers are connected to it. 
If there are any containers using the network, you must stop and disconnect them first.
Here are the steps to remove the network:
List Networks: First, confirm that the network exists by listing all Docker networks.
   docker network ls

Disconnect Containers: If there are any containers connected to rag_api_network, 
you need to stop and disconnect them. You can list the containers connected to a network using:
   docker network inspect rag_api_network

Then, stop and disconnect any running containers:
   docker stop <container_id>
   docker network disconnect rag_api_network <container_id>

3. Remove the Network: Once no containers are connected, you can remove the network.
   docker network rm rag_api_network

This will delete the rag_api_network from your Docker setup. If you encounter any issues, 
ensure that all containers are properly disconnected and stopped before attempting to remove the network.
